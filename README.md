# Environments:
This repository contains a number of different example environments for use with the `godot-environment` library.

Each environment is a Godot project folder with its own resources. Each one should contain a human controlled scene that allows you to test the environment manually.

**This is project and and the `godot-environment` project are both heavily work-in-progress.**
